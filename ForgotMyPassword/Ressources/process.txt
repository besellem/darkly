We first go to http://192.168.56.101/?page=signin
next we click on "forgot password" (http://192.168.56.101/?page=recover)
there's a form with a text field and a submit button
there's a hidden field with the value of the email
we just change the email address from "webmaster@borntosec.com" to anything else
click on submit

There's the flag

the flag is a SHA256 hash decrypted into "recoverthis",
don't know how to use this yet

Done!
