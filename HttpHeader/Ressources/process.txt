go to http://192.168.56.101/?page=e43ad1fdc54babe674da7c7b8f0127bde61de3fbe01def7d00f151c2fcca6d1c

when inspecting, you'll see two lines in comment:
- "You must cumming from : "https://www.nsa.gov/" to go to the next step"
- "Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot."

We understand that by changing the http header from the request we'll be able to
retrieve the flag.

Let's just do a simple request with those headers by using request.sh script.


Done!
