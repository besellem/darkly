go to http://192.168.56.101/robots.txt

we can see 2 folders :
/whatever
/.hidden

we will start with /whatever :
go to http://192.168.56.101/whatever/
there's one file :
http://192.168.56.101/whatever/htpasswd

In it there's an id "root" and a hash
We decrypt the hash with https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier
Turns out that it's an MD5 hash, and it's value is "dragon"

Now we can try to login :
go to http://192.168.56.101/admin
login with id "root" and password "dragon"

Done!
