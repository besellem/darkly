# Here I first tried some SQL injections but everything seemed to work fine.
# i then tried some XSS attacks.

on the "Message" input I tryed:
<script>hello</script>

and it was only showing "hello" as a result.
I then tried some special characters on the "name" input until it worked

Try "<" or ">"; it's displaying the flag

Done !
